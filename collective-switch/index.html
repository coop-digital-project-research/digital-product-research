      <h1><span>Collective switching for good</span></h1>
      <time>June 2017</time>

    <section class="situation">
      <p>
        Around half of us have never switched energy company. Most non-switchers are with one of the ‘big six’ energy companies, paying more for power from oil, coal or fracked gas. Could we motivate non-switchers to switch to do good instead of profit?
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>
        Switchers and non-switchers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Why do people switch? And why do so many people not switch? For people who do switch, it’s about price, which you’d expect.
      </p>

      <aside>

          <img src="../Assets/Collective_switch/ofgem-tweet.png" alt="Tweet from Ofgem excouraging people to switch and save" />
        <figcaption>
          Ofgem are keen to encourage people to switch energy companies
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </aside>

      <p>
        People who haven’t switched are much more interesting - knowing that they’re overpaying doesn’t make them switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-switchers don’t see much benefit of switching, and they perceive that researching, understanding and switching takes a lot of effort. True, the mechanics of switching is easy, but they’re right that it requires a level of commitment to learn to understand energy companies well enough to make a decent comparison.
      </p>

      <aside>
        <figure>
          <img src="../Assets/Collective_switch/green-tariff.png" alt="Details of an ethical pricing policy - one tariff at the same price" />
        <figcaption>
          Small, green energy companies offer a good tariff that stays good
        </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </aside>

      <p>
        15% of people switch often - every year - but the rest don’t. Small, green energy companies have used this insight: most people just don’t want to bother switching regularly - so these companies give them a good tariff that stays good, and don’t hike the price after a year.

          Non-switchers come from all backgrounds - your income or status won’t affect how likely you are to switch or not switch

      <h2>
        A community-benefit approach to switching
      </h2>
      <p>
        With that in mind - price doesn’t appear to influence non-switchers, they don’t see the benefit, and they expect it to be really difficult - we tried out a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tested working with schools to try and encourage non-switching (grand)parents to switch to green energy - not to save money, but to raise money for their school.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          school raise funds from the commission on every switch
        </li>
        <li>
          families help the school
        </li>

      <h2>
        Our two big assumptions
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1. There’s value for the schools to recruit parents.</strong> We emailed 50 schools and 25 parent teacher associations inviting them to raise money with us. We tracked the emails and could see around half the emails being opened, but didn’t hear back from any. Granted, it was nearing the end of term, and many of the email addresses where generic, but it didn’t look promising.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Helping a school is compelling enough to make people switch.</strong> We also spoke to five parents of school children about their attitudes towards their energy providers. It was a chance to learn about them and what’s stopped them switching in the past.

        Take this with a pinch of salt, we’d paid them an incentive for the research. The real test would be to get a fundraising campaign up and running. That said, all the participants thought this idea sounded good.

        One participant told us how their school raises money in a similar way. For every online purchase a family makes, the school gets a bit of cash. Interesting.

          It’s a really good idea. We do something similar at the moment. If you shop online, you go through a certain platform and the school gets money. It’s heavily used.

          I reckon half of the 90 sets of parents used it. It was a success.

    <h1>How we ran this experiment</h1>
    <h2>One-to-one interviews with potential users</h2>
<p>
   We only have a few days to organise interviews, which means we have to use the quickest way to find relevant people to talk to. We use social media and our professional and social networks to carry out highly targeted recruitment to find people who closely represent our target audience.
</p>
<p>
   We observe and record our interviews, taking care to remove any details that would identify the participants. Everyone involved signs a participant agreement and we give vouchers to the people who take part as a thank-you for their time.
</p>
<p>
    We use active listening techniques to get deeper insights into the reasons behind comments that people make. We have learnt a lot from experts in Co-op Digital such as <a href="http://trvrs.co/book">Andrew Travers</a> and <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/03/09/small-is-beautiful-user-research-and-sample-sizes/">James Boardwell</a> that have helped us get the most from these interviews, thank you.
