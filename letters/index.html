      <p>
        Many of the things in our homes connect to the internet, allowing us to control them with our phones via an app, to be part of an online community or to access content online.
      </p>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>Everything’s sharing everything</h2>
      <p>
        Many of these devices have cameras and microphones, capturing highly personal information inside the home.
      </p>

      <p>
      It’s not always clear that data is being captured, how that information
      is used, or  who has access to it. This is often hidden inside
      complicated terms and
      conditions.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <figure class="alt">
          <img src="../Assets/Scout/image02.jpg" alt="A smart television with a Google terms and conditions dialog box" />

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </aside>

      <p>
      For some devices, the manufacturer’s business model is selling personal information on to others

       <em>“If you’re not the customer, you’re the product”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, many of these devices have security vulnerabilities, opening them up to attackers on the internet.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="what-we-did">
      <h2>We showed people problems in their home</h2>


      <p>
        We prototyped Scout, a service that monitors devices connected to a home wifi
        network, and showed it to four people who use these kinds of devices in
        their homes.
      </p>

      <figure class="img-wide">
        <img src="../Assets/Scout/image01.png" alt="A fridge magnet that we imagined could alert the homeowner to new vulnerabilities on their network" />
        <figcaption>
          A fridge magnet could alert the homeowner to new vulnerabilities on their network
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We showed them some potential vulnerabilities in a home network that was similar to their own. They saw how personal information was transferred to a third party company, allowed via a clause buried deep within a product’s terms and conditions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="question">
          How much do people understand about the risks of connected devices?
        </h2>
      <section class="answer">
        <p>
          Most of our participants had not thought about how secure or private the connection between their devices and the internet was.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            No I didn’t realise. It’s quite scary actually.

      <section class="answer">

        <p>
          Despite our participants obvious discomfort at learning about the flaws
          in devices they had bought, they weighed up their options and broadly
          decided to take no action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cost was a factor; smart devices had been a significant outlay, and the
          idea of reducing their functionality was not appealling.

    <h1>How we ran this experiment</h1>
    <h2>Talking to experts</h2>
<p>
  We talk to experts in the areas we’ve been looking to find out what they think the big challenges are. We then turn these challenges into positive “how might we?” questions which we try to answer as we carry out the experiment.
</p>
<p>
  We’re lucky enough to work for a large organsiation with a lot of expertise in-house - we’re grateful to our colleagues who have given us their time and their knowledge. We’ve found that the Co-op name has opened doors for us, and external experts have also let us interview them.
</p>

    <h2>From idea to software in 5 days</h2>
<p>
    We tested this idea by building and testing a prototype in 5 working days. Our goal was not to test the effectiveness of the prototype, but to use it as a starting point for a conversation. Using the <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-understand-day-1-e164f76e69cf#.9nh30f8z4">GV product design sprint</a> framework, we were able to quickly test our assumptions and make something that felt real enough to try out on some potential users. The conversations we have with users as they interact with our prototype tell us if an idea is worth persuing or not.
</p>

    <h2>One-to-one interviews with potential users</h2>
<p>
   We only have a few days to organise interviews, which means we have to use the quickest way to find relevant people to talk to. We use social media and our professional and social networks to carry out highly targeted recruitment to find people who closely represent our target audience.
</p>
<p>
   We observe and record our interviews, taking care to remove any details that would identify the participants. Everyone involved signs a participant agreement and we give vouchers to the people who take part as a thank-you for their time.
</p>
<p>
    We use active listening techniques to get deeper insights into the reasons behind comments that people make. We have learnt a lot from experts in Co-op Digital such as <a href="http://trvrs.co/book">Andrew Travers</a> and <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/03/09/small-is-beautiful-user-research-and-sample-sizes/">James Boardwell</a> that have helped us get the most from these interviews, thank you.
