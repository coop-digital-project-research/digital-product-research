<h2>One-to-one interviews with potential users</h2>
<p>
  We use a usability testing company to find people who closely represent our target audience, and to host our interviews in a specialist lab.
</p>
<p>
   We observe and record our interviews, taking care to remove any details that would identify the participants. Everyone involved signs a participant agreement and we give vouchers to the people who take part as a thank-you for their time.
</p>
<p>
    We use active listening techniques to get deeper insights into the reasons behind comments that people make. We have learnt a lot from experts in Co-op Digital such as <a href="http://trvrs.co/book">Andrew Travers</a> and <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/03/09/small-is-beautiful-user-research-and-sample-sizes/">James Boardwell</a> that have helped us get the most from these interviews, thank you.
