      <h2>‘Smart’ or safe?</h2>
      <p>
        More of the things we buy for our homes connect to the internet. Part of the installation of these devices involves agreeing to terms and conditions - and the sneaky clauses that allow our privacy to be compromised.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <h2>Deciding which TV to buy is hard enough</h2>
      <p>
        People don’t take data security into account when buying connected devices. Product reviews and press coverage about new products focus on features and specifications, not privacy and invasive, confusing terms and conditions.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="what-we-did">
      <h2>Influencing consumers by influencing journalists</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted to find out if we could encourage the journalists who write product reviews to focus on security by showing them the dodgy clauses in manufacturers’ terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We showed five journalists and reviewers a prototype of Legalease, a community-driven terms and conditions analysis site where contributors annotate legal terms and leave questions for manufacturers to answer.

    <section class="question">
      <h2>How do journalists write stories?</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="answer">
      <h3>Somewhere on the scale between objectivity and subjectivity</h3>
      <p>
        Different publications have different approaches. One of the journalists we spoke to carried out repeatable, objective experiments to decide which product was best. Another wrote for a site where personal and political opinions are encouraged, and was able to bring his own views into his reviews.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I love the fact that I’m able to write about stories that I care about personally. That I’m able to use my own opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also able to occasionally put my political slant on it, I think Brexit is a terrible idea… I wrote a story about a story that the iPhone is going to cost 20% more because of Brexit.

      </blockquote>



      <h3>Using personal and professional relationships to understand complex issues</h3>

      <p>
        The journalists we spoke to used different sources for their stories: PR agencies, manufacturers, their own research, awareness of trends through personal contacts and online communities (Reddit). Some were happy to be contacted by PR companies and manufacturers. Others deliberately avoided them, only contacting them to give them a chance to respond to a negative story.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I’ve seen PR companies get better at what they do&hellip; Generally products and stories get pitched. Could be research, tip or physical product.
        </p>

          One cultivates individuals in companies, contacts and one also sometimes you know very often you formally deal with a press team to get comment generally on stories which are adverse to them or where you’d be compromising into your contact to quote or whatever, to some extent you have to protect your sources … but again that’s just journalism.

          Occasionally a great place to find breaking news is Twitter and Reddit, but you have to be extremely careful when using those sources. So you have to make the effort to corroborate it.

        They recognised it for what we intended it to be. The user comments highlighted ambiguity, but they didn’t find that useful. They were concerned about the validity of contributors; they wanted to hear from experts and others with authority.

          Erm. I think, if there’s some sort of hover over JaneS’s profile and see that she was a lawyer or student lawyer or that she’s a security advocate. Verified profiles would be cool, like Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone’s going to be highlighting the most important parts of the Ts and Cs, the assumption is that they are qualified and they are competent to do that because they could get it wrong or miss something.

        No - not like this. It was clear what Legalease was for. However, participants’ reactions were mixed as to whether it was something they’d use during their writing process. They wanted to see stronger expert opinions and summaries (as opposed to commentary and questions) and worried about how qualified the contributors were.

      <p>
        Some of the journalists we spoke to perceived their audience as either not caring about privacy issues, or being resigned to a lack of privacy. What does motivate their readers however are the more obvious, less conceptual problems - being bombarded by targeted ads, concerns about being ‘ripped off’. Our goal should be to connect the more abstract issues around data protection and privacy to the real-world manifestations of those issues. Only then should we explain why these annoying things keep happening - and in plain, everyday language.

    <h1>How we ran this experiment</h1>
    <h2>From idea to software in 5 days</h2>
<p>
    We tested this idea by building and testing a prototype in 5 working days. Our goal was not to test the effectiveness of the prototype, but to use it as a starting point for a conversation. Using the <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-understand-day-1-e164f76e69cf#.9nh30f8z4">GV product design sprint</a> framework, we were able to quickly test our assumptions and make something that felt real enough to try out on some potential users. The conversations we have with users as they interact with our prototype tell us if an idea is worth persuing or not.
</p>

    <h2>One-to-one interviews with potential users</h2>
<p>
   We only have a few days to organise interviews, which means we have to use the quickest way to find relevant people to talk to. We use social media and our professional and social networks to carry out highly targeted recruitment to find people who closely represent our target audience.
</p>
<p>
   We observe and record our interviews, taking care to remove any details that would identify the participants. Everyone involved signs a participant agreement and we give vouchers to the people who take part as a thank-you for their time.
</p>
<p>
    We use active listening techniques to get deeper insights into the reasons behind comments that people make. We have learnt a lot from experts in Co-op Digital such as <a href="http://trvrs.co/book">Andrew Travers</a> and <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/03/09/small-is-beautiful-user-research-and-sample-sizes/">James Boardwell</a> that have helped us get the most from these interviews, thank you.
